# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

Horiseon wanted their website to be more accessible to screen readers, so the goal of this project was to refactor the HTML and CSS to be semantic and improve accessibility while making the code concise and easily read.

This is what was done to meet this goal:

- Changed html tags to more semantic tags
- Gave all images an 'alt' description
- Commented at the start of each major section of html and css, so future users can easily make changes
- The CSS elements were reorganized to follow the flow of the html elements
- Combined many classes to reduce css redundancy
- One of the nav links did not function, so that was fixed

All of this was achieved without changing the appearance or functionality of the website.
